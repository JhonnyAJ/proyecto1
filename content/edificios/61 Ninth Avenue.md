61 Ninth Avenue is new office building in the Meatpacking District in Manhattan that is articulated with multiple setback terraces, cantilevers, and a floor-to-ceiling glass façade integrated within a modular frame that organizes the mass of the structure. The flexibility in the design of 61 Ninth Avenue responds to a particular market demand of the Meatpacking District neighborhood, where competing offices are often housed in converted industrial spaces. The inherent character of these large manufacturing spaces is that they provide large open spaces with generous ceiling heights in contrast to center core high rise office towers commonly seen in Midtown Manhattan.
