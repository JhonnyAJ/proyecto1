A helical skyscraper that makes a distinct mark on the Dubai skyline, Cayan Tower is at once remarkable and subtle. The residential tower is a pure expression of the idea that a building’s form should directly follow its structural framework.

While the skyscraper’s 73 floorplates are all identical, each is slightly rotated against the story below it, resulting in a full 90-degree twist over the course of the tower's 307-meter rise. The benefits of this unique form, besides the aesthetic ones, are manifold. Wind load and solar heat gain are reduced compared to a rectilinear building of the same height, and a greater number of tenants are afforded desirable views of the nearby marina and gulf.
