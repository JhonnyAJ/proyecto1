The 32-story-tall Mashreq Bank Headquarters, with its boldly cantilevered form, will be a new landmark in the Dubai skyline. In contrast to the futuristic glass and steel towers of Dubai, this is a simple form clad in stone panels. The L-shaped typical floor plate opens to the north with its orientation allowing offices on both sides of the courtyard to have clear glazing protected from solar gain by the building itself. These facades allow panoramic views toward Sheikh Zayed Road.
