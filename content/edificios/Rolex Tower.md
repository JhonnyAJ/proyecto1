Evoking a shimmering desert mirage, Rolex Tower is part of the next generation of skyscrapers on Dubai’s main thoroughfare, Sheikh Zayed Road. Through its tasteful elegance and quiet minimalism, the tower continues SOM’s tradition of exemplary mixed-use development in the Middle East and beyond.

The high-rise building contains offices, apartments, two exclusive residential penthouses, retail space, and a nine-story parking garage. A grand entryway leads into a lobby that features modern decor and a dynamic, stainless steel sculpture by James Clar.
