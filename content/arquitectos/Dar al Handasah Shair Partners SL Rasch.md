About
Dr Mahmoud Bodo Rasch founded architectural practice Rasch & Associates in 1980 and the firm Sonderkonstruktionen und Leichtbau (SL GmbH) in 1991, which was renamed SL Rasch GmbH Special & Lightweight Structures in 1998. Rasch’s many years of engagement in the Near East and the implementation of extremely adaptable lightweight structures have led to some spectacular major projects for the holy sites of Islam, including the world’s biggest clock tower in Mecca and the Medina Piazza Shading Project.
